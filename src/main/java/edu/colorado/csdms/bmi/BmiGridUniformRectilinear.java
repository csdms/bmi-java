/**
 * Methods that describe a uniform rectilinear grid.
 * <p>
 * In a 2D uniform grid, every grid cell (or element) is a rectangle and all
 * cells have the same dimensions. If the dimensions are equal, then the grid is
 * a tiling of squares.
 * <p>
 * Each of these functions returns information about each dimension of a grid.
 * The dimensions are ordered with "ij" indexing (as opposed to "xy"). If there
 * were a third dimension, the length of the z dimension would be listed first.
 * Note that the grid shape is the number of nodes in the coordinate directions
 * and not the number of cells or elements. It is possible for grid values to be
 * associated with the nodes or with the cells.
